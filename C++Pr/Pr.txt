1. Create a class representing a `Movie` with attributes like `title`, `genre`, and `releasedYear`. Demonstrate the instantiation of objects using array and accessing their attributes.



2. Define a class named `BankAccount` with private attributes `accountNumber`, `balance`, and `ownerName`. Encapsulate these attributes using appropriate access specifiers. Implement public member functions to credit, debit, and display the balance. Demonstrate encapsulation by interacting with the class through its member functions.



3. Define a base class `Vehicle` with private attributes `model` and `speed`. Implement public member functions for setting and getting these attributes. Derive two classes, `Car` and `Bike`, from the `Vehicle` class. Implement methods to calculate the time taken for a certain distance based on the speed of each vehicle. Demonstrate abstraction by calling the time calculation methods for both `Car` and `Bike`.



4. Extend the `Vehicle` hierarchy from Question 3 to include a virtual function `displayDetails()`. Implement the `displayDetails()` function in each derived class to print information specific to the vehicle. Create an array of `Vehicle` pointers, pointing to objects of different vehicles. Demonstrate polymorphism by calling the `displayDetails()` function for each object.



5. Define an abstract class `Shape` with pure virtual functions `calculateArea()` and `draw()`. Implement concrete/normal classes `Circle` and `Rectangle` that inherit from `Shape`. Demonstrate polymorphism by creating an array of `Shape` pointers pointing to objects of both `Circle` and `Rectangle`. Call the `calculateArea()` and `draw()` functions for each object.
